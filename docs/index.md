#### About

Here you will find information about each module of the project. We have divided the documentation into three main sections:

1. Documentation on the development of a machine learning model:
   In this section you will find a detailed description of the stages for the development and training of machine learning models. We provide information on data selection and preprocessing, algorithm selection, model setup and training, as well as evaluation and optimization of their performance.

2. Web Application Development Documentation:
   Here are the steps of creating a web application. We talk about the technology and frameworks that were used to develop and deploy a web application.

3. Packaging a project in Docker:
In this section we show the process of packaging a project into a container using Docker. You will read what instructions were used and how the project is structured in Docker.

Select the appropriate section from the list above and start studying the documentation for detailed information and project guides.

We wish you good luck!
